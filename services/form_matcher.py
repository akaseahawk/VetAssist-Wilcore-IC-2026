"""
services/form_matcher.py

Maps eligible benefits to VA forms and resolves which fields can be prefilled
from the veteran's profile vs. which still need input.

HOW IT WORKS:
    1. get_forms_for_benefits() finds which forms in the catalog correspond
       to a veteran's eligible benefit IDs.
    2. prefill_fields() walks each form's required fields, looks up values
       in the veteran profile, and marks each field as 'prefilled' or 'missing'.
    3. build_field_summary() counts known vs. missing fields and returns
       a list of missing ones for the chat layer to ask about.
    4. get_missing_fields_for_veteran() is a convenience wrapper used by the
       upload route and document suggestions endpoint.

WHY pure Python, no database:
    Form matching and prefill are deterministic lookups — no ML, no API calls.
    All form definitions and field mappings live in data/forms_catalog.json.
    This keeps the service fast, stateless, and easy to test.

WHY source_documents pass through here:
    Each field definition in the catalog may include a source_documents list
    (e.g. ["DD-214"]) identifying which physical document contains that field.
    form_matcher passes this through so the frontend can show a photo upload
    button on missing fields without needing to know the catalog structure itself.
