services/document_vision.py

WHY this exists:
  Veterans often have the information we need locked inside physical documents —
  a DD-214 in a folder, a VA letter in a drawer, a discharge paper they've had for decades.
  Instead of asking them to type it out from memory, we let them photograph or scan it
  and send the image to Claude, which reads it like a human would.

  This is multimodal vision — NOT traditional OCR.
  Traditional OCR does pixel-level character scanning. It fails on skewed photos,
  handwriting, stamps, and low-contrast text.
  Claude vision understands the document semantically: it knows what a DD-214 looks like,
  where the "Character of Discharge" box is, and what to do with a partially visible field.

  WHY every extracted field goes back to the veteran for confirmation:
  We never assume extracted data is correct. A blurry photo, a redaction, a typo on the
  original document — any of these could cause a wrong value. The veteran confirms each
  field before it populates their form. VetAssist does not auto-fill without consent.

FLOW:
  1. Receive image bytes + MIME type + list of fields we want
  2. Build a Claude prompt that describes exactly which fields to extract
  3. Send image + prompt to Claude via the messages API (vision input)
  4. Parse the JSON response into a structured dict
  5. Return extracted fields + confidence notes for each
  6. Caller (main.py) returns to frontend; veteran confirms before any field populates

# --- Field definitions for documents we know about ---
# WHY a lookup table: each document has a known layout and known field positions.
# Telling Claude exactly what to look for improves accuracy vs. open-ended extraction.

# WHAT DOCUMENTS WE CAN SCAN AT STEP 1 (identity/profile prefill)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY a separate list: Step 1 scanning is about getting the veteran's basic
# identity and service history into the own-profile form quickly. These are
# documents a veteran might realistically have on them or nearby.
# Driver's license is intentionally excluded — it has no military service data.
# VA letters are included because they confirm branch, period of service, and
# sometimes disability rating from a single page.

Document context: {doc_def["document_description"]}

Your task: Extract the following specific fields from the document image. Return ONLY a JSON object — no explanation, no markdown, no code fences. Just the raw JSON.

Fields to extract:
{field_lines}

Rules:
- If a field is clearly visible and readable, include its value as a string.
- If a field is partially visible, include what you can read and add a note in parentheses, e.g. "2003-06 (partial — day not visible)".
- If a field is not present in this document, set its value to null.
- If a field is redacted or intentionally obscured, set its value to "REDACTED".
- Never guess or invent values. Only extract what is actually visible.
- For dates, use YYYY-MM-DD format if possible.
- For names, use "Last, First Middle" format if that matches the document.

Return format (example):
{{
  "name": "Sanchez, Maria Elena",
  "branch": "Army",
  "service_start": "2003-06-15",
  "discharge_type": "Honorable",
  "rank": null
}}
