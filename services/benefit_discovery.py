services/benefit_discovery.py

Benefit discovery layer — surfaces VA benefits a veteran may want to explore.

HOW THIS WORKS:
    Two modes depending on whether an Anthropic API key is configured:

    LIVE MODE (API key set):
        Claude reads the veteran's profile and uses its own knowledge of VA
        benefits to suggest what may be worth exploring. Claude reasons from
        the profile the same way a knowledgeable VSO would — looking at branch,
        service dates, discharge type, conditions, deployments, and known
        circumstances to suggest relevant benefit categories.

        WHY Claude instead of hardcoded rules:
        VA benefit eligibility is nuanced. Rules change. Edge cases exist.
        A veteran's situation rarely fits neatly into simple if/else logic.
        Claude can reason across combinations of factors the way a human advisor
        would — and frame results as possibilities, not determinations.

    FALLBACK MODE (no API key):
        The hardcoded rules engine in eligibility.py runs instead.
        Same "worth exploring" framing — just less nuanced.
        This keeps the app fully runnable without an API key for setup,
        demos without connectivity, and collaborators during development.

CRITICAL FRAMING RULES:
    - These are NOT eligibility determinations.
    - The VA and the veteran's VSO make the final determination.
    - We surface possibilities so the veteran knows what to ask about.
    - Every result includes a VA.gov link for the veteran to research themselves.
    - The veteran decides whether to proceed — we help them prepare if they do.

FUTURE / AGENTIC PATH (post-MVP, do not build now):
    An agent with VA.gov search access could query live policy documents,
    check for newly enacted legislation (like the PACT Act), and handle
    edge cases that require reading current regulations. This would be a
    separate research agent that runs only when Claude flags uncertainty.

{profile_summary}

Available benefit categories to consider:
{catalog_summary}

Your task:
1. Review this veteran's profile carefully.
2. For each benefit category listed, decide if it is genuinely worth this veteran exploring
   based on their specific situation. Do NOT surface benefits that clearly do not apply.
3. For each benefit you surface, provide:
   - A plain-language explanation of why it may apply to THIS veteran specifically
   - A clear statement that this is not a determination — they should talk to their VSO or the VA
   - The benefit ID exactly as listed above

Return your response as a JSON array. Each item must have these exact fields:
{{
  "benefit_id": "the exact ID from the catalog",
  "worth_exploring": true or false,
  "plain_language_reason": "2-3 sentences explaining why this specific veteran may want to look into this benefit, written directly to them",
  "important_note": "This is not an eligibility determination. Talk to your VSO or the VA to confirm whether this applies to your situation."
}}

Only include benefits where worth_exploring is true.
Be conservative — only surface what genuinely seems relevant.
Do not guess or assume facts not in the profile.

Important constraints:
- Your VA knowledge has a training cutoff. If a benefit rule or eligibility threshold
  may have changed recently (e.g. PACT Act expansions post-2022, new rating schedules),
  note this uncertainty in the plain_language_reason so the veteran knows to verify.
- Do not present your assessment as current or authoritative — frame it as a starting
  point for a VSO or VA conversation, not a conclusion.
- If you are not confident a benefit applies, set worth_exploring to false.
  A shorter accurate list is better than a longer speculative one.
