main.py — VetAssist FastAPI application

HOW THIS APP WORKS (read this first):
    VetAssist follows a simple, linear flow:
      1. Veteran is selected → profile loaded from JSON
      2. Eligibility engine runs rules → returns list of likely benefits
      3. Veteran sees benefits, selects a form to work on
      4. Form fields are prefilled from profile → missing fields identified
      5. Veteran edits/confirms prefilled fields in the UI (no assumptions)
      6. Claude asks for missing fields conversationally — one at a time
      7. Output package generated (post-MVP)

    Claude is used for conversation only — the rules engine handles eligibility.
    Claude can add nuance and explain benefits using its innate knowledge,
    but it does not make eligibility decisions.

WHY FastAPI:
    - Lightweight, fast, and has automatic API docs at /docs
    - Built-in request/response validation via Pydantic
    - Easy to swap in a real database or auth layer later without rewriting routes

WHY JSON files instead of a database:
    - Zero setup — clone and run, no database server needed
    - Easy to read and edit for demo purposes
    - Clear separation: data lives in /data, logic lives in /services
    - Post-MVP: replace load_json() calls with database queries — nothing else changes

RUNNING LOCALLY:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cp .env.example .env           # add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for live chat
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    open http://localhost:8000

API ENDPOINTS:
    GET  /                          → serves the frontend HTML page
    GET  /api/veterans              → list all veteran profiles (id, name, branch)
    GET  /api/veterans/{id}         → full profile for one veteran
    GET  /api/eligibility/{id}      → run benefit eligibility for a demo-profile veteran
    POST /api/eligibility/own       → same as above but accepts inline profile in request body
    GET  /api/forms/{id}            → matched forms + prefilled fields for a demo-profile veteran
    POST /api/forms/own             → same as above but accepts inline profile in request body
    POST /api/chat                  → send a message to the conversational assistant
    POST /api/upload                → accept document photo, extract fields via Claude vision (Step 3)
    GET  /api/upload/suggestions/{id}→ return which document types have a veteran's missing fields
    POST /api/scan-identity         → Step 1 only — photo of DD-214/military ID/VA letter → prefill own-info form
    GET  /api/scan-identity/document-types → list of scannable document types for Step 1 picker
    POST /api/generate-output       → generate + stream a PDF package (cover page + field summary)
    GET  /health                    → health check

TODO (post-MVP — do not add these to the MVP):
    - POST /api/generate-output: actual XFA form filling (requires Adobe SDK or
      cloud service; current implementation generates a summary sheet instead)
    - Expand document_vision.py: add more DOCUMENT_FIELD_DEFINITIONS beyond DD-214 and 21-4142
    - Authentication via login.gov or VA identity service
    - Replace JSON files with PostgreSQL or DynamoDB
    - Deploy to AWS Bedrock + GovCloud for FedRAMP-eligible federal use

    Discover benefits worth exploring for a veteran.

    HOW IT WORKS:
      - If ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set: Claude reads the veteran profile and uses
        its own VA knowledge to surface relevant benefits — reasoning the way
        a knowledgeable VSO would, not from hardcoded rules.
      - If no API key: falls back to the rules engine in eligibility.py.
      - Either way, results are framed as 'worth exploring' — never a determination.

    WHY this is a separate route from /api/forms:
      The veteran sees benefits FIRST and decides which ones to pursue.
      They then select a form. Two-step flow matches the intended UX.

    IMPORTANT: This system does not determine eligibility.
      The VA and the veteran's VSO make that determination.
      We help veterans understand what to ask about and prepare paperwork.

# Step 1 identity scan — photo of DD-214, military ID, or VA letter
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY a separate route from /api/upload:
#   /api/upload is tied to Step 3 — it extracts fields for a specific VA form
#   that the veteran is working through. It requires a veteran_id and a list
#   of form fields to look for.
#
#   /api/scan-identity is for Step 1 — the veteran hasn't loaded a profile yet.
#   We extract basic identity and service history fields to pre-populate the
#   own-info entry form so they don't have to type everything manually.
#   No veteran_id, no form context — just "who are you and when did you serve?"

    WHY a summary sheet and not a filled PDF:
        VA forms use Adobe XFA interactive format. Python PDF libraries cannot
