# VetAssist

**VA Benefits & Forms AI Assistant | Wilcore Innovation Challenge | April 20–27, 2026**

> Veterans deserve better than a stack of confusing forms and a Google search.
> VetAssist identifies likely benefits, explains required forms, prefills what it can,
> and asks plain-language follow-up questions for the rest.

**Setup (one time)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akaseahawk/VetAssist
cd VetAssist
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # optionally add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
                               # optional: CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6 (this is the default)
```

**Run / re-run**
```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
# open http://localhost:8000
```

The app runs without an API key. Claude responses fall back gracefully so the
demo works locally even in an offline environment.

## Act 1 — The Problem

### Why Veterans Are Left Behind

> *"The average VA disability claim takes over 125 days to be considered backlogged —
> and the confusion before that clock even starts is the part no one has solved."*
>
> The VA defines a backlogged claim as one pending more than 125 days.
> In January 2025, the average processing time was 141.5 days.
> As of early 2026 the VA has reduced this to roughly 80 days — real progress.
> But the barrier VetAssist addresses comes *before* any of that:
> figuring out which benefits to apply for, which forms are needed, and what goes on each one.
> Most veterans never file because they don't know where to begin.
>
> *Sources: [VA Benefits Claims Backlog Under 100K — VA.gov Press Room, Feb 2026](https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-benefits-claims-backlog-under-100k-for-first-time-since-2020/) ·
> [VA Announces Major Improvements in Benefits Processing — VA.gov, Apr 2026](https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-announces-major-improvements-in-benefits-processing-and-delivery/)*

VetAssist doesn't touch the adjudication window — the VA controls that.
It removes the barrier *before* the clock starts: helping veterans know which benefits
are worth exploring, which forms those require, which documents they already have
that contain the needed information, and how to fill in what's left conversationally.
The problem isn't just how long claims take — it's how many veterans never file at all.

Veterans earned their benefits through service and sacrifice. Getting those benefits
should not require a law degree, a research project, or a stack of paper forms
with overlapping fields filled out by hand.

**What veterans face today:**

- No single entry point to understand what they qualify for
- 3–5 forms per claim, many still flat PDFs or scanned images — not digital
- The same name, SSN, service dates, and address re-entered on every form
- Form instructions written for administrators, not veterans
- Incomplete submissions → rejections → months of delay → benefits never received

*Pain points: No guidance · Paper-first · Repeated data entry · Plain-language gap*

---

## Act 2 — The Solution

### What VetAssist Does

Three things, in order:

**Understand** — Read the veteran's profile and surface the benefits worth exploring
in plain language, with reasons specific to that veteran's situation.

**Prepare** — Show the required forms, prefill every field already known
from the veteran's profile, and surface which other documents (like a DD-214)
may already have the missing information. The veteran can take a photo of that
document — Claude reads it using computer vision (not OCR), extracts the fields,
and presents them for the veteran to review and confirm before anything populates.
For fields with no document source, Claude asks conversationally — one question at a time.

**Connect** — Point the veteran to their VSO, the VA, and the specific VA.gov pages
they need. VetAssist prepares them. The VA and VSO make the final call.

### Why Not Just Use VA.gov, VA Form Wizard, or benefits.gov?

This question will come up. Here's the honest answer:

| Tool | What it does | What it doesn't do |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **VA.gov "How to Apply"** | Explains what benefits exist | No eligibility discovery, no prefill, no guidance |
| **VA Form Wizard** | Helps pick the right form for a single benefit | One form at a time, no prefill, no conversational follow-up |
| **benefits.gov** | Lists federal programs with eligibility criteria | No form prefill, no veteran-specific reasoning, no follow-up |
| **VSO appointment** | Expert human guidance | Requires scheduling, often weeks out, inconsistent availability |
| **VetAssist** | Discovers likely benefits from profile, maps to forms, prefills known fields from profile, suggests which documents (DD-214, etc.) may have missing fields, reads those documents with Claude vision, asks for the rest conversationally | Not a determination — prepares veteran for VSO/VA conversation |

The gap VetAssist fills: **no single existing tool does discovery + prefill + document vision + conversational guidance in one session**.
VA.gov has the information. VetAssist connects it to the veteran's specific situation — including reading the paper documents they already have.

### Why Now

- The VA processes over 1 million disability claims per year ([VA FY2023 Benefits Report](https://www.benefits.va.gov/REPORTS/abr/))
- Post-9/11 veterans are aging into benefit eligibility windows now
- VA.gov digital modernization is ongoing but form complexity remains
- Claude and other frontier LLMs now reliably explain forms in plain language
- Wilcore's SDVOSB identity and existing VA relationships create a direct path to pilot this

### Impact

> **CEO lens:** Wilcore is an SDVOSB built to serve veterans. This project does exactly that —
> and it comes with a credible path to a federal proposal. A working prototype today is a BD
> asset tomorrow. The before/after story is memorable: veterans go from a confusion and delay
> to a guided 30-minute process. That's the kind of impact that wins challenges and opens
> doors with VA program offices.

- Reduce time-to-submission from hours or days to under 30 minutes
- Reduce incomplete submissions through prefill and guided follow-ups
- Scalable to any federal benefit program with known forms and eligibility rules
- Maps directly to active VA modernization priorities
> - *Credible BD path for Wilcore: VA T4NG (Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology Next Generation) Task Order, CIO-SP4, or 8(a) sole-source under 38 U.S.C. § 8127 as a certified SDVOSB — no competitive tender required below $M, SPRUCE IDIQ.* **needs review**

Quantified (conservative): If 10% of ~1M annual VA disability claims used a tool like this
and saved 2 hours each, that's ~200,000 veteran-hours recovered per year.

## Act 3 — How It Works

> **CTO lens (primary):** Every layer is replaceable without touching the others.
> JSON → DB, Anthropic → Bedrock, local → GovCloud. The MVP is the simplest
> credible version of the full architecture — not a throwaway.

### Eligibility Engine Detail

**No hardcoded rules by default — Claude drives this.**

When `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, Claude reads the veteran's profile and uses its
own knowledge of VA benefits to surface what's worth exploring. It reasons from
branch, service dates, discharge type, conditions, and deployments — the same
factors a knowledgeable VSO would consider.

The hardcoded rules engine in `services/eligibility.py` runs only as a fallback
when no API key is configured. This keeps the app fully runnable for demos, development,
and offline environments without compromising the default experience.

**Critical framing (non-negotiable):**
- Always: *"worth exploring"* — never *"eligible"* or *"you qualify"*
- Always: disclaimer banner before any benefit cards
- Always: *"Talk to your VSO or the VA to confirm"* on every benefit
- Always: VA.gov link on every benefit card
- VetAssist is a preparation tool — the VA makes the determination

### What Is Real vs. Mocked

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Veteran profile loading | **Real** | Reads from `data/veterans.json` |
| Benefit discovery | **Real** | Claude-first; rules fallback |
| Form field prefill | **Real** | Maps profile fields to form field metadata |
| VA form titles and VA.gov links | **Real** | 5 actual VA forms with public URLs — 16–34 fields each |
| Manual profile entry | **Real** | Veterans can enter their own info instead of picking a demo profile |
| Step 1 document scan | **Real** (with API key) | Veterans photograph a DD-214, military ID, or VA letter; Claude extracts identity/service fields and pre-populates the own-info entry form; veteran reviews every value before proceeding |
| Conversational assistant | **Real** (with API key) | Graceful placeholder without |
| Document photo → prefill (Claude vision) | **Real** (with API key) | Veteran photos a DD-214 or other doc; Claude extracts fields; veteran confirms before anything populates |
| Document type suggestions | **Real** | System tells veteran which document likely has each missing field |
| PDF download package | **Real** | Cover page (VSO contacts, next steps, branch-specific benefits) + field summary sheet (green = confirmed, amber = still needed). Generated by `services/pdf_generator.py` using reportlab. Veteran downloads after confirming fields or at end of chat. |
| VA API integration | **Stub** | Uses local JSON instead |
| Veteran PII | **Synthetic** | No real data used |

## Act 4 — Implementation Path Forward

> **COO lens:** This is a bounded, realistic one-week build with a clear demo path.
> The scope is intentionally constrained — no database, no cloud, no auth.
> Every dependency is justified. If this moves past the challenge, the roadmap
> is phased and each sprint has a defined deliverable.

### Feasibility — Why This Works in One Week

| Task | Effort |
|------|--------|
| Backend + eligibility engine | 1–2 days |
| Forms catalog + prefill logic | 1 day |
| Frontend (HTML/JS) | 1 day |
| Claude chat integration | 0.5 days |
| Docs + diagrams + README | 0.5 days |
| Demo recording + submission | 0.5 days |
| **Total** | **~5–6 developer-days** |

**Why it stays simple:**
- No database — JSON files for everything
- No authentication — synthetic data only
- No cloud deployment — runs on any laptop with Python
- One HTML page — no framework, no build step
- PDF download is a preparation summary sheet, not a filled VA form. VA forms use Adobe XFA format that Python libraries cannot write into. The summary sheet + cover page is the honest, reliable alternative.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI + uvicorn (lightweight, production-grade)
- Anthropic Python SDK (optional — app runs without it)
- No paid services required to run the MVP

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Benefit suggestions are not legally precise | Always framed as "worth exploring." Disclaimer before every card. VSO recommended. |
| Form field metadata may drift from VA.gov | Catalog is versioned JSON; easy to update. Direct VA.gov links included. |
| Claude API unavailable or slow | Graceful rules fallback. Demo does not depend on live API. |
| PDF is a summary sheet, not a filled form | VA forms use XFA format. Summary sheet + cover page is the honest alternative. Clearly described in the UI before download. |
| Judges ask about PII / data security | Synthetic data only. No real veteran data stored anywhere. |
| "Why not just use VA.gov?" | VA.gov has no eligibility discovery, no prefill, no conversational guidance. VetAssist bridges those gaps. |

### Federal Applicability

> **CTO lens (primary):** The architecture is intentionally modular and swap-ready.
> The model layer is abstracted in `services/claude_chat.py` — one environment variable
> switches from Anthropic direct to AWS Bedrock. The data layer is JSON today and
> PostgreSQL or DynamoDB tomorrow with no service-layer changes. The eligibility engine
> is pure Python rules — no ML dependency, fully auditable, easy to extend.
> The federal deployment path runs through Bedrock on AWS GovCloud (FedRAMP-authorized)
> with a FISMA Low/Moderate ATO.

- **Primary agency:** Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
  - Aligns with VA Digital Modernization Strategy and Benefits Modernization priorities
  - Directly addresses the "Benefits at First Ask" theme from the Wilcore challenge
- **Compliance path:**
  - Section 508: accessible HTML, keyboard-navigable, screen-reader compatible with minor additions
  - FedRAMP: swap Anthropic API for AWS Bedrock (Claude) on FedRAMP-authorized infrastructure
  - FISMA Low/Moderate: appropriate for a VA benefits guidance tool with synthetic or de-identified data
- **Contract structure:** Deliverable as a Task Order under VA T4NG or CIO-SP4, or via 8(a) sole-source under 38 U.S.C. § 8127 (SDVOSB preference). Wilcore's SDVOSB certification means no competitive tender is required below $4M — a significant acquisition advantage
- **Broader applicability:** Same architecture applies to any federal benefit program with known forms (SSA, HUD, USDA rural benefits)

### Why This Scores Well Against the Wilcore Rubric

| Criterion | Weight | How VetAssist Addresses It |
|-----------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Impact** | 30% | Reduces veteran friction in a high-stakes process; clear federal proposal path |
| **Originality** | 25% | Combines benefit discovery, form mapping, prefill, document photo-to-prefill (Claude vision), and conversational guidance — no single VA tool does all five |
| **Feasibility** | 20% | Runs locally today; realistic one-week scope; clear post-MVP roadmap |
| **Clarity** | 15% | One-screen demo, plain-language output, diagrams, before/after story |
| **Collaboration** | 10% | Three defined teammate roles with clear ownership and bounded time commitment |

Directly aligns with the Wilcore challenge themes: *"Benefits at First Ask"*
and *"Closing the Digital Divide"* — and with Wilcore's SDVOSB identity.

## Demo Narrative

> This is the story to tell in the video and presentation.

**Before:** Maria is an Army veteran. She knows she may have PTSD from her deployments
in Iraq and Afghanistan. She tries to file a claim but doesn't know where to start.
She Googles "VA disability forms," finds a 47-page PDF, and gives up.

**With VetAssist:**
1. Maria opens VetAssist, selects her profile, enters her own information, or photographs her DD-214 to auto-fill the entry form
2. In seconds, she sees benefits worth exploring: disability compensation, PTSD benefits, VA health care
3. She sees matching forms — one flagged as "not fully digitized"
4. Most fields are already filled in from her profile (name, service dates, branch, conditions)
5. For missing fields, VetAssist tells her: “Your DD-214 may have 3 of these — do you have it nearby?”
6. She photographs her DD-214 with her phone and uploads the photo
7. Claude reads the document image (not OCR — it understands the form semantically), extracts the fields, and shows them to Maria for review
8. She sees all extracted values in editable inputs and corrects anything that looks wrong, then clicks Confirm
9. The chat assistant handles any remaining gaps in plain conversational language
10. She sees a summary ready to bring to her VSO or the VA
